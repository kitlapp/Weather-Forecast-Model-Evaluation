# Weather Forecast Model Evaluation

This repository contains a comprehensive evaluation of three weather forecast models (GFS, IFS, and ICONEU) against actual weather station data as part of a structured Python project assigned to me. It applies scikit-learn statistical metrics and trigonometric methods to assess the accuracy of forecasts for wind direction, temperature, and wind speed. The documentation and this assignment as a whole, demonstrate strong analytical skills and an eagerness to research and solve complex problems.

## FILES INCLUDED:

1. 5 X IDE files (main.py, cleaning.py, visualizations.py, evaluation.py, dictionaries.py)
   <br>--> You should only run the main.py file and all code files will run seamlessly.
3. 1 X Documentation File (Doc_Weather_Models_Evaluation.pdf)
   <br>--> This document provides a step-by-step overview of the project, detailing both non-technical and technical steps, including results analysis and a comprehensive discussion of the project.
4. 9 X Visualizations (barplot_1.png, barplot_2.png, boxplot_1.png, circ_hist_1.png, heatmap_1.png, heatmap_2.png, timeseries_1.png, timeseries_2.png, timeseries_3.png)
     <br>--> These figures represent the exploratory data analysis and are provided in PNG format.
5. The README file

## HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT:

Alternative 1: Due to data sharing restrictions, I can execute the scripts on my PC while sharing my screen with anyone interested. 

Alternative 2: If you prefer, I can privately share the data with you. Then follow the instructions below:
1. Download the project as a zip file or clone the repository to your local machine. Assuming you have already got the datasets, you own all required files.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type
   <br>--> conda create --name 'YourEnvName' -c conda-forge python=3.12.4 matplotlib=3.9.1 seaborn=0.13.2 numpy=2.0.0 pandas=2.2.2 scikit-learn=1.5.1 pyarrow=17.0.0 tabulate=0.9.0
4. Activate the newly created environment.
5. Open PyCharm setting your project directory as project in PyCharm.
6. Activate the environment and configure it with your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
7. Let PyCharm load the new env.
8. Run the main.py file.
9. Enjoy!

*** CAUTION: Installing from default Anaconda channel will raise the error PackagesNotFoundError ***
